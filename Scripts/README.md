# README for "Scripts" Folder

This folder contains scripts designed for analyzing, clustering, and measuring the coverage of Java microbenchmarks. The scripts are organized into two subfolders: **code coverage - jacoco** and **clustering microbenchmarks**.

---

## **code coverage - jacoco**
This subfolder contains scripts for:
- Measuring and processing code coverage of JMH and ju2jmh benchmarks using JaCoCo.
- Converting JaCoCo XML reports into CSV format, focusing on covered lines only.

---

## **clustering microbenchmarks**
This subfolder includes Python scripts used for:
- Measuring code coverage overlap between JMH and ju2jmh benchmarks.
- Generating text files that organize benchmarks into clusters.
- Creating Java source code for benchmark clusters.

--- 

Each subfolder contains the necessary scripts to automate tasks like coverage measurement, benchmark clustering, and code generation for performance testing in Java applications.
